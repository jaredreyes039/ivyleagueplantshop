## Welcome to Ivy League College Town Plant Shop!

## Goal
The goal of this project was to build a functional front-end for an ecommerce website. The only nonfunctional component currently is the checkout - intentionally left under construction as I continue to improve in back-end programming.

## Project Highlights
- Functional cart and shop to make the site a functional front end for an ecom business
- Use of React.js to build the entire app
- Use of React router to create inpage links
- A particular attention to data organization and coding architecture
